Just last year I was introduced to working with visual basic application (VBA) on excel. During that time I was tasked with compiling large amounts of data onto one file as it was necessary for monthly meetings. This task was previously done manually, but I thought then what if it could be done automatically? I purchased my first coding book and jumped right into learning for loops. At first learning this new skill was a challenge, but in doing so, I learned so much about a field I initially knew nothing about. A month later I wanted to implement further automation into my department, but I realized that my learning became capped by my full-time job at Princess Margaret, and more advanced resources and topics became harder to understand. It was at this time where I decided to change my life by enrolling into a 3-month Fully-Immersive Web Development course at Bitmaker Labs.

The moment I stepped into the building, reality came crashing down and my anxieties got the best of me when I realized  that it was too late to turn back. That day I met my classmates, the instructors, student experience manager, and career coach. At the end of my first day I was left with excitement from taking my first step into the tech industry. The next 3 months were composed of staying up late, reiterating the topics I learned to myself, and constant disbelief in my ability to use CSS. It was rough, but everyday was a blessing as I was learning so much more than I could possibly learn by myself. The faculty at Bitmaker is very encouraging, but the friends I made within my cohort were the support that kept my beliefs and projection of the future up high. The course ended late November 2018, it was a bitter-sweet moment when the last day of class rolled by. We were tasked now to finding a job and learning individually through tutorials and projects.

The website that’s hosting this blog section was built with everything I’ve learned since graduating from Bitmaker. Retrospectively, I’m happy that I made this change in my life. I realized that everything takes time, and it’s just a matter of time until things fall into place. My goal is to learn more about the overall structure of producing a website, and what I need to do to make my websites accessible to everyone. Everyday, I like to challenge my curiosity, and the reason why is because coding is fun.","position":{"start":{"line":11,"column":1,"offset":2193},"end":{"line":11,"column":665,"offset":2857}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":11,"column":1,"offset":2193},"end":{"line":11,"column":665,"offset":2857}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":12,"column":1,"offset":2858}}}}
